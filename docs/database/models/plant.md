## Relationships

- (future) **Plant → Species** (many‑to‑one)  
  A plant references a single species entry, but many plants may reference the same species.

- **Plant → History** (one‑to‑many)  
  A plant can have multiple history events (watering, fertilizing, repotting, etc.).

## Firestore Storage

- Current:
  `plants/{plantId}`

- Planned:
  `/users/{userId}/plants/{plantId}`

- History subcollection:
  `/users/{userId}/plants/{plantId}/history/{eventId}`

## Constraints and Rules

- `name` must be a non‑empty string
- `creationDate` must always be set
- `wateringFrequency` must be a positive number if provided
- `lastWatered` may be null if the plant has never been watered
- `notes` is optional and unstructured
- `species` is an optional string
